In this lecture we started off by learning C++ syntax about how we take input and output in a compiler.

One new thing we learnt here was that the compiler does not read space, tab and break-line(enter) characters into the input but if we are taking input of a string where taking the input of space is important, then we will have to use cin.get().

If we don't know how many input there are going to be, we can use a while loop as follows- while(cin>>x){}

Then we went on to learn about conditionals and how they are used.

After that we udnerstood while loops and their significance in code. We also learned about its implementation by writing a few basic programs like finding sum till n.

Then lastly we tried implementing few basic pattern problems using nested loops and rest of the pattern problems were done in the next lecture.
