In this lecture, we studied more about memory allocation. We understood in depth about how integers are stored in binary system and how we can find the binary representation of a number or find the number from its binary representation in a program.

Later on we inplemented the same in our IDE.

Then we also learned how to change a negative decimal representation of a number to binary and vice versa. This can be done by
