In this lecture we implemented all the STL header files and the functions mentioned for each of these data structures. We learned a lot of commands where we can access optimized code for some of the most difficult problems in few lines of code through STL and is considered to be one of the strongest tool for competitive programming.

The array STL is implemented using static arrays and has limited functionalities so it has very limited use and vectors are used more.

Similarly for deque, it is also implemented using static arrays, the only difference being its implementation is more complex because of using many static arrays and using some hashing mechanism to remember what stuff is present where which gives us the power of indexing along with push and pop operations can be done on both start and end of the data structure.

Similarly, in case of vectors also, static arrays are used for implementation but as they are dynamic in nature, they are executed by alloting them static arrays and if it gets full and user wants to push more elements, the existing array is deleted and another array with double the size is alloted to it where new elements are pushed. Due to this specific reason, STLs consume a lot of extra memory.

In the case of list STL data structure,  it is implemented using doubly linked list, so indexing and other such properties cannot be done. Other than that, all the advantages that linked list data structure offer that arrays don't are also offered so it depends on the case if we want to use list or some other STL.

STL Stack:
In the background, a stack in the STL is often implemented using a deque (double-ended queue) or a list as its underlying data structure. The choice between these two structures usually depends on performance considerations and specific use cases. Each time an element is pushed onto the stack, it is typically added to the front of the deque or list. When popping elements off the stack, the top element (which is the front element in the deque or list) is removed. This design ensures constant-time insertion and removal operations at the top of the stack. However, direct iteration isn't supported because the STL stack is designed to be a simple LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, prioritizing operations like push and pop.

STL Queue:
The STL queue is commonly implemented using a deque (double-ended queue) or a list, similar to the stack. However, in contrast to the stack, elements are added to the back of the deque or list when enqueued and removed from the front when dequeued. This design adheres to the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, ensuring that elements are processed in the order they were added. Iterating through a queue typically involves dequeuing elements one by one until the queue is empty, as direct iteration isn't directly supported due to the specific nature of the queue data structure.

STL Priority Queue:
A priority queue in the STL is often implemented using a binary heap data structure, which allows efficient insertion, deletion, and access to the highest priority element. In a binary heap, elements are arranged such that the highest priority element is at the root, and each node's priority is greater than or equal to its children's priorities. When elements are inserted into the priority queue, they are placed at an appropriate position in the heap based on their priority. When elements are removed (typically the highest priority element), the heap is restructured to maintain the heap property. While priority queues support iteration, it's not guaranteed to iterate in any specific order, as it's based on the internal organization of the binary heap. Hence, direct iteration using a range-based for loop might not produce elements in a sorted order, as it depends on the underlying heap structure.

<iostream>:
Overview:
The <iostream> header file in C++ provides a rich set of tools for performing input and output operations. It is part of the broader I/O stream library in C++, which includes input streams (std::istream), output streams (std::ostream), file streams (std::ifstream, std::ofstream), and string streams (std::stringstream). These tools enable C++ programs to interact with various input and output devices, including the console, files, and strings.

Key Concepts:
Standard Streams:

std::cin: The standard input stream. It is typically used for reading input from the user.
std::cout: The standard output stream. It is used for printing output to the console.
std::cerr: The standard error stream. It is used for printing error messages to the console.
Stream Buffers:

Behind each input and output stream (std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr) lies a stream buffer, which handles the actual input/output operations.
Stream buffers manage data buffering, formatting, and interfacing with external devices such as files or the console.
Input and Output Operators:

Input operations typically use the >> operator to extract formatted data from input streams (std::cin).
Output operations typically use the << operator to insert formatted data into output streams (std::cout, std::cerr).
Stream Manipulators:

Stream manipulators are special functions used to modify the behavior of input and output streams.
They can control formatting, such as setting field width, precision, or inserting special characters like newline (std::endl) or tab (std::setw()).
Stream Classes:

C++ provides a hierarchy of stream classes, including base classes std::istream and std::ostream, and derived classes like std::ifstream, std::ofstream, and std::stringstream.
Stream classes encapsulate common I/O operations and provide interfaces for reading from or writing to various sources, such as files or strings.
Input/Output State:

Input and output streams maintain state information, including flags indicating the stream's condition (e.g., whether an error has occurred, end-of-file has been reached).
Stream state can be queried and modified using member functions like std::ios::good(), std::ios::fail(), std::ios::clear(), etc.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    // Basic input/output operations
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> num;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << num << std::endl;

    // File input/output operations
    std::ofstream outFile("output.txt");
    outFile << "Hello, world!";
    outFile.close();
    
    std::ifstream inFile("input.txt");
    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(inFile, line)) {
        std::cout << line << std::endl;
    }
    inFile.close();

    return 0;
}
Remarks:
Understanding the nuances of input/output operations, stream buffering, and stream states is crucial for writing robust and efficient I/O code in C++.
Stream manipulators provide powerful tools for controlling the format of input and output data, enhancing readability and usability.
Careful error handling and state management are necessary to ensure proper functioning of I/O operations, especially when dealing with file I/O and user input.

<array>:
Overview:
The <array> header file in C++ provides the std::array container, which is a fixed-size array with a compile-time constant size. It is a part of the C++ Standard Library's container framework and offers a safer and more convenient alternative to built-in arrays (T[]). std::array provides features like bounds checking, iterators, and compatibility with standard algorithms.

Key Concepts:
Fixed-Size Array:

std::array represents a fixed-size array with a compile-time constant size.
Unlike built-in arrays, the size of a std::array is known at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime.
Container Interface:

std::array conforms to the container interface defined by the C++ Standard Library, making it compatible with algorithms and other containers.
It provides member functions and iterators similar to other container classes like std::vector and std::list.
Bounds Checking:

std::array supports bounds checking, which means accessing elements out of bounds will result in an exception (std::out_of_range) being thrown.
This provides safer access to elements compared to built-in arrays, where accessing out-of-bounds elements results in undefined behavior.
Iterators:

std::array provides iterators (begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend()) for traversing its elements.
Iterators allow for generic algorithms to be applied to std::array, similar to other container classes.
Efficiency:

std::array is as efficient as built-in arrays in terms of performance and memory usage.
It provides a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory, ensuring efficient element access and storage.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    // Initializing a std::array
    std::array<int, 5> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "First element: " << arr[0] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Last element: " << arr[arr.size() - 1] << std::endl;

    // Iterating through the array
    for (const auto& elem : arr) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Remarks:
std::array provides a safer and more efficient alternative to built-in arrays in C++.
It offers the convenience of container-like operations while preserving the efficiency of built-in arrays.
Understanding the features and usage of std::array is important for writing modern C++ code that leverages the standard library's capabilities effectively.

<stack>:
Overview:
The <stack> header file in C++ provides the std::stack container adapter, which is a container adaptor that provides a stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out) data structure. It is implemented using an underlying container, such as std::deque, std::list, or std::vector, and offers a restricted interface compared to the underlying container, focusing only on stack-specific operations like push, pop, and top.

Key Concepts:
Stack Data Structure:

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top.
Elements are added to the top of the stack using the push() operation and removed from the top using the pop() operation.
Container Adaptor:

std::stack is a container adaptor that wraps an underlying container (e.g., std::deque, std::list, std::vector) and provides stack-specific operations.
It restricts access to the underlying container's functionality, exposing only the operations necessary for stack manipulation.
Push and Pop Operations:

std::stack provides push() and pop() member functions for adding and removing elements from the top of the stack, respectively.
These operations maintain the LIFO (Last In, First Out) property of the stack.
Top Operation:

std::stack provides the top() member function, which returns a reference to the top element of the stack without removing it.
It allows for accessing the top element without modifying the stack.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    // Creating a stack of integers
    std::stack<int> myStack;

    // Pushing elements onto the stack
    myStack.push(10);
    myStack.push(20);
    myStack.push(30);

    // Accessing the top element
    std::cout << "Top element: " << myStack.top() << std::endl;

    // Popping elements from the stack
    myStack.pop();

    // Checking if the stack is empty
    if (!myStack.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Stack is not empty." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Remarks:
std::stack provides a simple and efficient way to implement a stack data structure in C++.
It abstracts away the details of the underlying container, allowing for flexible usage with different container types.
Understanding the stack data structure and its operations is essential for effectively using std::stack in C++ programs.

<queue>:
Overview:
The <queue> header file in C++ provides the std::queue container adapter, which is a container adaptor that provides a queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) data structure. Similar to std::stack, it is implemented using an underlying container and offers a restricted interface tailored for queue operations such as push, pop, and front/back access.

Key Concepts:
Queue Data Structure:

A queue is a linear data structure in which elements are added at one end, called the rear or back, and removed from the other end, called the front.
Elements are inserted at the back of the queue using the push() operation and removed from the front of the queue using the pop() operation.
Container Adaptor:

std::queue is a container adaptor that wraps an underlying container (e.g., std::deque, std::list) and provides queue-specific operations.
It restricts access to the underlying container's functionality, exposing only the operations necessary for queue manipulation.
Push and Pop Operations:

std::queue provides push() and pop() member functions for adding and removing elements from the queue, respectively.
push() inserts elements at the back of the queue, while pop() removes elements from the front of the queue.
Front and Back Access:

std::queue provides front() and back() member functions for accessing the front and back elements of the queue, respectively.
front() returns a reference to the front element without removing it, while back() returns a reference to the back element.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a queue of integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Pushing elements into the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Accessing the front and back elements
    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Back element: " << myQueue.back() << std::endl;

    // Popping an element from the queue
    myQueue.pop();

    // Checking if the queue is empty
    if (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Queue is not empty." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Remarks:

Iterators allow for generic algorithms to be applied to std::vector, similar to other container classes.
Efficiency:

std::vector provides efficient element access and storage, with elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
It dynamically reallocates memory when necessary to accommodate more elements, but this process can be relatively expensive compared to adding elements to the end of the vector (push_back()).
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Creating a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> myVector;

    // Adding elements to the vector

Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    // Creating a deque of integers
    std::deque<int> myDeque;

    // Adding elements to the front and back of the deque
    myDeque.push_front(10);
    myDeque.push_back(20);

The sorting criterion is determined by a comparison function or by using the default comparison function provided by the key type's operator<.
Balanced Binary Search Tree:

Internally, std::map is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree (e.g., red-black tree) to ensure efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.
Efficiency:

std::map provides fast average complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, typically O(log n) on average.
It offers efficient key-based retrieval of elements, making it suitable for applications requiring fast access to key-value mappings.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Creating a map of string keys and int values
    std::map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting elements into the map
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 10;
    myMap["orange"] = 7;

    // Accessing elements using the [] operator
    std::cout << "Number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Iterating through the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Remarks:
std::map provides a versatile and efficient way to manage key-value mappings in C++.
It maintains elements in a sorted order based on the keys, allowing for efficient key-based retrieval operations.
Understanding the features and usage of std::map is important for efficiently managing key-value mappings in C++ programs.

<set>:
Overview:
The <set> header file in C++ provides the std::set container, which is an associative container that stores unique elements in a sorted order. Unlike std::map, which stores key-value pairs, std::set stores only the keys, and the elements are stored in such a way that they are always sorted according to a strict weak ordering criterion specified by a comparison function. std::set offers fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations, making it suitable for applications requiring a sorted collection of unique elements.

Key Concepts:
Associative Container:

std::set is an associative container that stores unique elements in a sorted order.
Unlike std::map, it stores only the keys, and the elements are stored in a way that ensures they are always sorted according to the comparison criterion.
Ordered Storage:

Elements in a std::set are stored in a sorted order according to a strict weak ordering criterion specified by a comparison function.
The sorting criterion determines the relative order of elements in the set.
Balanced Binary Search Tree:

Internally, std::set is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree (e.g., red-black tree) to ensure efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.
Efficiency:

std::set provides fast average complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, typically O(log n) on average.
It offers efficient retrieval and manipulation of elements, making it suitable for applications requiring a sorted collection of unique elements.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
    // Creating a set of integers
    std::set<int> mySet;

    // Inserting elements into the set
    mySet.insert(10);
    mySet.insert(5);
    mySet.insert(20);

    // Checking if an element exists in the set
    if (mySet.find(5) != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << "Element 5 found in the set." << std::endl;
    }

    // Removing an element from the set
    mySet.erase(5);

    // Iterating through the set
    for (const auto& elem : mySet) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Remarks:
std::set provides a versatile and efficient way to manage sorted collections of unique elements in C++.
It maintains elements in a sorted order according to the comparison criterion, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation operations.
Understanding the features and usage of std::set is important for efficiently managing sorted collections in C++ programs.

using namespace std;:
Overview:
The using namespace std; statement is often included in C++ programs to simplify code by avoiding repetitive use of the std:: prefix when accessing names from the standard library. It effectively brings all names from the std namespace into the global namespace of the program.

Key Concepts:
Namespace Usage:

C++ standard library components, such as containers (e.g., vector, map), algorithms (e.g., sort, find), and I/O streams (e.g., cout, cin), are defined within the std namespace.
Without the using namespace std; statement, you would need to prefix these names with std:: to access them.
Scope Implications:

Adding using namespace std; introduces all names from the std namespace into the global namespace of the program.
This means that names from std can be accessed directly without prefixing them with std::.
Potential Issues:

While using namespace std; can make code shorter and more readable, it may also lead to naming conflicts if multiple namespaces define names with the same identifier.
It is generally recommended to avoid placing using namespace directives in header files, as they affect the entire translation unit and can lead to unintended consequences for code that includes the header.
Usage:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Accessing names from the std namespace without prefixing
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
Remarks:
While convenient, the using namespace std; statement should be used judiciously and limited in scope to the smallest reasonable context to minimize potential naming conflicts.
In larger projects or when writing library code, it is often preferable to avoid using namespace directives and instead qualify names explicitly with std:: to improve code clarity and prevent unintended interactions.
